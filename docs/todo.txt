__TODO__


- DDD widget



___NEXT___


- ACE widget gets set properly, pulls data with Submit Form

- Cleanup the _id=(__get.param._id), so that it is unified for all the elements, whether it is the page primary or a secondary filtered list.  It should be standard to set it before running the DWI.

- Make selection of DDD when deciding the WI for the DWI, so that the DWI input can be automated.

- Make adding new DWIs to pages need no UDN coding, the GUI walks through the creation.

- Item Control can delete the current page element.  Figure out DDD method to populate what is needed on this page to do that with no UDN.

- WI have "rendering styles", which is the DDD selection, when also specifies which UDN will be pasted into udn_data_json, which is the specific configuration needed to render a table a given way.
    - The WI creates the "Collection" for a table, but there can be several rendering styles, which are stored UDN and DDD groupings, so that we have them both together.

____UDN Core____


- Lists can be values of Map elements
- Map keys can be a UDN statement, compound.  Forced into a string afterwards (through ProcessArgs)
